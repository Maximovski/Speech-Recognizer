TODO:

* Wods splitting +++ UNIT TESTS (small entropy)

** Invalid splitting for m2, m3 (Rabinel-Lamel algorithm)
** Do not trim frames in samples!


* Check the logic!!!


* Remove useless includes
* Memory leaks
* Code style



Shelved tasks

* Imporove cmd interface
** Sequence of arguments shouldn't be matter
** Appropriate error messages


Dinctionary:

odin, dva, tri, chetire, pyat', shest', sem', vosem', devyat', desyat'


Cmd samples 

* Splitting a source into samples -i samples/female1.wav -s _split
* Listing all available models: -l
* Adding a sample into a model: -i samples/female1/sampleFile.1.wav -a odin
* Recognition of a sample -i samples/female1/sampleFile.1.wav -r
