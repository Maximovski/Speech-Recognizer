YAZZ (Yet Another Speech Recognizer) is my modest attempt to implement a text recognition application.

So, let's hope it will be successful! :)

Note this project has external dependencies:
* libpng (can be installed as a separate library for both Linux and Windows);
* gtest (in case of using MinGW for Windows you may have to amend CMake's FindGTest module and fix patch io.h library);

It is tested to run on both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04.
